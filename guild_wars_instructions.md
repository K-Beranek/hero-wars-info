# Guild Wars Instructions

- Free for all unless stated otherwise
  - You decide on what to attack
  - If there is nothing tempting and you don't need to attack immediatelly then please check again later
- We go for the titan Bridge first
  - This is usually the toughest fortification
  - Do not attack too hard targets unless necessary. There are other people who may take a spot in single attack.
- We always evaluate our chances of capturing the Citadel
  - Check the defenders and how many attacks we have left.
  - Some guilds put their best in the Citadel and we may actually get more points by taking everything else.
- If we go after the Citadel we focus on the easiest of the elemental gateways
  - Once through we attack the Citadel
- If we are skipping the Citadel or when already taken then we focus on the other 3-spot buildings
- We usually leave the 2-spot buildings for last
  - there are often well defended too as these are the only ones open before you conquer the Bridge

# Guild Wars Hints

- Do not go after too tough opponent. Only attack what you are sure you can win.
- This is team effort. Others may be in better position to win the fight. Don't feel afraid to go after easy targets.
- It is 20 points per defender. Regardless of their actual power. Easy 3-spot is worth more than tough 2-spot.
- There is 20 bonus points per defender when a fortification is fully conquered. So finishing a building is usually the best.
- Finishing a spot only yields the remaining points. Defeating full spot gives 20 points. Finishing thus only makes sense when you capture the building.
- Failed attack is better than missed attack. Even a +1 point is better than no points.
- Before attacking a spot where attack was already done you must evaluate the situation.
  - The defenders will already be damaged but they will also have energy bars charged to some point.
  - Most common issue is charged Dante or K'arkh. You enter the fight, tickle them and they wipe the floor with you before you do anything.
  - Applies to titans too. Charged supertitants, tanks ready to stun/shield etc. It often cuts the fights very short.
  - You can check replay of the earlier attack to see the energy bars of the enemies at the end of the fight.
  - If not sure then assume they are charged and will start the fight with a big hit. Can you handle that before your heroes/titans gain energy too?
- For titans keep the rock-paper-scissors in mind.
  - Water has bonus against Fire, Fire has bonus against Earth, Earth has bonus against Water.
  - Light and Dark have bonuses against each other.
  - When well played 500k Earth team can take out 600k Water team. Even on auto 500k Fire can wipe out 600k Earth.

## Mind titan totems
Their level and number of stars. These are not added to the team power.
- Water totem heals. They can heal a lot. You must deliver a lot of damage and fast. And then either win or die fast. Dying slowly means the enemy heals a lot.
- Fire totem does a lot of damage, especially to Earth titans. You can spam it or play even on auto.
- Earth totem prevents damage and also does damage. This one is hardest to use. On auto it is usually half wasted. On manual this can cause huge damage to Water.
- Totems are charged whenever the related titans gain energy. It works even with a single titan left in the fight.
- If there are less than three titans of the element the totem won't spawn. When attack fails but the it kills sufficient number of titans the next attack would not need to face the totem.
- Light and Dark work similarly. They need only two titans in order for the totem to spawn. I have no experience with them yet.

## Mind supertitans
- Araji does a lot of damage to single target rapidly.
  - Easily countered by Sigurd by using his ult, rising his shield and preventing all the damage.
  - Nova with her ult can stun Araji and thus break the attack. But it depends on where Araji stands.
  - Moloch can stun Araji with his punch. But only when he stands head to head with Araji.
  - Earth totem can help a lot here too, preventing good portion of the damage and reflecting it back at Araji.
- Eden tosses a boulder, doing reasonable damage on all enemy titans at once.
  - Stun him with Moloch or Nova. No other way to prevent that damage.
  - Earth totem can help a lot here again, preventing a lot of the damage and reflecting it back at Eden.
- Hyperion hits the enemies with wave of Ice. The enemies furthest away get hit the most.
  - There is no feasible elemental titan to prevent this.
  - Earth totem can help once more, the same way for the other supertitans.
- Dark and Light are not fun to fight either. But I have experience to fight those yet.

## Mind enemy heroes
Even huge power difference in your favor may not be enough. Some heroes are so called hard counters to other heroes. Learn the most common counters and avoid mistakes. Quick (incomplete) list:
- Do not use Yasmine or Sebastian to attack teams which have Helios (Helios scores bonus damage when enemy hero does a critical)
- Do not use physical heroes against strong Dante (he dodges and causes huge damage back every so often)
- Do not use magic damage dealers against teams with Isaac (he prevents part of the damage and charges super attacks with it)
- Do not fight against strong Iris or Amira unless you know how
- Keira, Orion and especially Ginger charge enemies a lot. Use them in a way to kill the opponent fast. Or don't use them at all.
- Do not use Orion, K'arkh or Nebula against team with Satori. Unless you know how to protect them against his purple skill.
- When attacking a team with Rufus be sure you can kill him. You need physical damage or Morrigan. He can't be finished with pure or magic damage.
